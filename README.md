# derivative-calculator

This project calculates the derivatives of a list of equations from a textfile.

The given equations must follow the following constraints:
- the equations can only use the variable 'x'
- any trig terms cannot have exponents
- the exponent of a variable can only be from -10 to 10

The calculated derivatives are given as output to another textfile.
